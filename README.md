# Cube Evader Game in Unity

This game is my first attempt at learning C# and using Unity. All code is written entirely in C#. 

This was created from a tutorial that I followed by Brackeys on Youtube from his series "How to make a Video Game".

The game is a simplified version of Cubefield in which you are a cube that must dodge the incoming obstacles to proceed in the game where the difficulty increases per level.

# To Use
